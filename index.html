<h1>Questions about the website:</h1>
        <h3>Q:Whats a hidden heavy? </h3>
        <h3>A:Heavy is a character from the game tf2, and a few pages will have links to hidden pages containing what I like to call hidden heavy's. (Please don't try to get to these pages by exploits or something, it ruins the fun and the point) This will happen later sometime idk lol</h3>
        <h3>Q:Whats ROMs of the week?</h3>
        <h3>So there is a tool at</h3><a href="https://randomizer.smrpgspeedruns.com/">randomizer.smrpgspeedruns.com</a><h3>that allows you to randomize ROMs at a set difficulty if you like and every week I regenerate a ROM for each difficulty. Easy, Advanced, and Expert! simple.</h3>
        <h3>Q:What do I do here?</h3>
        <h3>Well I kinda already answered that near the top of the page but since nowadays people have the memory of a goldfish (not saying my memories amazing either) but right now all you can really do is play the ROMs of the week and check out my unfinished cheat code documentation. I will add more later I promise and i'll even add all my states for RPG too later.</h3>
