<h1>Questions about the website:</h1>
        <h3>Q:Whats a hidden heavy? </h3>
        <h3>A:Heavy is a character from the game tf2, and pages will have links to hidden pages containing what I like to call hidden heavy's. This will happen later sometime idk lol</h3>
        <h3>Q:Whats ROMs of the week?</h3>
        <h3>So there is a tool at</h3><a href="https://randomizer.smrpgspeedruns.com/"></a><h3>that allows you to randomize ROMs at a set difficulty if you like and every week I regenerate a ROM for each difficulty. Easy, Advanced, and Expert! simple.</h3>
        <h3>Q:What do I do here?</h3>
        <h3>Well I kinda already answered that near the top of the page but since nowadays people have the memory of a goldfish (not saying my memories amazing either) but right now all you can really do is play the ROMs of the week and check out my unfinished cheat code documentation. I will add more later I promise and i'll even add all my states for RPG too later.</h3>
