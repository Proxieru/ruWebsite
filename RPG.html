          <h3>Documenting memory cheat codes</h3>
<h4>00:3032 (Character slots empty)</h4>
<h5>Findings: If you set it to 1, you can only play as mario, same for settings it to 2 or 3,</h5>
<h5>If set beyond 5 (the normal max amount that cnan be in your party) it will glitch out your switch menu and elements of the switch menu will overlap</h5>
<h4>00:3033-00:3037 (Character slots 1-5)</h4>
<h5>Findings: If set beyond normal amount of characters, for example if set to 6 it will put a bugged character into whatever slot you chose
<h5>For 6, the character name is Fire with a star before the name, possibly reading from enemy spell memory? it also uses the icon for the Frog Sages staff</h5>
<h5>and is also level 15 with glitched characters infront of the HP value which is 35/35. another thing about these bugged characters is that they often use different sprites in battle rather then the menu</h5>
<h5>and have no animations. Some are unstable and will freeze the game if you attack a enemy but some don't. Also they sometimes have Dumm or Dummy attacks which usually don't do anything or will freeze the game on use. Some also have giltched items such as a item named "Weapon" as a example</h5>
<h5>if you want to find more giltchy sprites/characters or behavior by all means I encourage you to grab a emulator, type in the cheat code like: 3033=(Number) and try it out! (this should work with the other codes too so try them out!)</h5>
